Git Journal

What I Learned today:
I learned how to use basic Git commands using the in-built command prompt and how it connects to Github, including from the site. Learn Git Branching also helped me with the introduction to Git commands such as commits, checkouts, and branches.

What I'm still confused about:
I'm still unsure about how to utilize Git properly, including staging, pushing, etc. There might be mistakes in the files I intended to stage. I hope I will learn how to turn this around soon.
